## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### **1. Favorite Apps and Features**
- **Instagram**:
  - Changing the background color of the messages screen.
  - Deleting old messages.
- **Spotify**:
  - Personalized playlists.
  - Offline music playback.
- **Notion**:
  - Cross-platform organization.
  - Custom templates.

### **2. App Idea: ColorSync - Adaptive UI for Mood, Weather & Focus**
#### **Purpose**
ColorSync enhances the **userâ€™s phone experience** by **automatically adjusting wallpapers, widgets, and UI colors** based on **mood, weather, and time of day**.

#### **How It Works**
- **Auto-Change Based on Schedule:** Users set **preferences** for UI color changes (morning = energizing, work = focus mode, night = relaxing).
- **Live Mood Tracking:** Users **log their mood**, and the app suggests a **color palette** accordingly.
- **Lock Screen & Widget Integration:** Wallpapers and widgets update dynamically.
- **Smart Scheduling:** Users set automatic **"mood triggers"** (e.g., yellow in the morning, blue for focus, red for workouts).
- **Customization:** Users **create & save** personalized color palettes.

#### **Why Itâ€™s Useful**
âœ… **Enhances Productivity** â€“ Color psychology improves focus & relaxation.  
âœ… **Reduces Decision Fatigue** â€“ No need to manually adjust UI colors.  
âœ… **Makes the Phone Feel Alive** â€“ Real-time, **adaptive UI experience**.  
âœ… **Fun & Personalized** â€“ Users express themselves through colors.  

#### **Future Features**
- ðŸŽµ **Music Sync** â€“ UI colors change based on currently playing songs.
- ðŸ“… **Calendar Sync** â€“ UI adapts based on upcoming events.
- ðŸ”— **Smart Home Integration** â€“ Syncs UI colors to smart bulbs like **Philips Hue**.

## Notes

- Initially set up the app using SwiftUI instead of Storyboard, which required recreating the project to use Storyboard.
- Connecting UI elements to the code was tricky at first but was resolved by using the Assistant Editor properly.
